I experienced issues with Colab's usage limits as I was finalizing my notebook. Because of this, none of the graphs in the pregenerated outputs for my code blocks will have titles. The code for adding appropriate titles is in those blocks though, so rerunning them should automatically add the titles to all of the graphs.

Additionally, there are some networks where the used hyperparameters have a chance of failing to converge sometimes. If this happens, rerun the code block until it decides to cooperate. You'll know it failed to converge if the reported testing loss is roughly 2.3 and the accuracy is ~10%. I've made sure that the pregenerated answers in the notebook do not suffer from this issue for convenience.
